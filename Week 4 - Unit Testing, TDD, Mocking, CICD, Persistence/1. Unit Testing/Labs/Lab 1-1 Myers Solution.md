# Lab 1-1 Myers Challenge

This challenge was originally proposed by Genford Myers in his book _The Art of Software Testing_ to illustrate the systemic process of developing text cases.

The image below describes the system to be tested
- The reference to punch cards provides a clue as to how ancient this problem is

The statement of the problem from Myers
- A program reads three integer values from a card.  
- The three values are interpreted as representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle. 
- The program prints a message that states whether the triangle is scalene, isosceles, or equilateral. 
- On a sheet of paper, write test cases (i.e., specific sets of data) that you feel would adequately test this program. 

First though, regard the description in the image as a specification since it actually is.
- Push back on the specification and identify what onr item needs to be added to it in order that is usable
- Go through the IEEE properties list as a guide

At the end of the exercise, the instructor will ask you to respond to the following questions

1. How many test cases did you come up with?
2. Would you be able to describe the process you used to come up with the test cases?
3. Given that there is such a variation in the test cases and the number of test cases in the class, how do we know which of these alternatives is the best? Are any of them adequate?
4. If you had to revisit your test cases a year from now to update them for regression testing, would you be able to replicate the logic used to develop your test classes
